This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Communication Language

**IMPORTANT**: Always communicate with the user in French, but write and comment code in English.

## Project Overview

OllamAssist is a JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA plugin that integrates with Ollama to provide AI-powered development assistance. It's written in Java with a Gradle Kotlin DSL build system and leverages LangChain4J for AI model integration.

### Key Features
- **AI-powered development assistance** - Chat, completion, and code analysis
- **Agent Mode** - Autonomous task execution with user validation
- **RAG integration** - Context-aware responses using project files
- **Git integration** - Automated commit messages and code operations
- **Step-by-step validation** - User control over agent actions

## Build System and Commands

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 (JDK 21)
- Ollama installed and running locally

### Core Commands

**Build the plugin:**
```bash
./gradlew build
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
./gradlew test
```

**Run benchmarks:**
```bash
./gradlew benchmark
```

**Build plugin distribution:**
```bash
./gradlew buildPlugin
```

**Clean build artifacts:**
```bash
./gradlew clean
```

**Run all checks (includes tests, benchmarks):**
```bash
./gradlew check
```

**SonarCloud analysis (requires SONAR_TOKEN):**
```bash
./gradlew sonar
```

### Testing Strategy

**IMPORTANT: Test-First Development Approach**
- **Always write tests first** before implementing new features (Test-Driven Development - TDD)
- When adding new functionality, start by writing failing tests that describe the expected behavior
- Implement the minimal code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor while keeping tests green
- Never reduce test quality or remove assertions to make tests pass - fix the implementation instead

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests: Located in `src/test/java/`
- Benchmark tests: Located in `src/benchmark/java/`
- JUnit Jupiter engine for unit tests
- AssertJ for assertions
- Mockito for mocking

**Test Quality Standards:**
- Maintain high test coverage and comprehensive assertions
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Include edge cases and error handling
- Write descriptive test method names that explain the behavior being tested

- **Unified interface** - Single screen for chat, validation, and results
- **Hybrid execution** - Native LangChain4J tools with JSON fallback
- **Model compatibility** - Works with Llama 3.1+, Mistral, and legacy models

### Architecture Components
```
src/main/java/fr/baretto/ollamassist/core/agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentCoordinator.java          # Main orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentService.java              # Hybrid execution (tools/JSON)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntelliJDevelopmentAgent.java  # Tool definitions with @Tool
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/                            # User interface components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ execution/                     # Task execution engines
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task/                          # Task definitions and results
```

### Documentation
For complete Agent Mode documentation, see:
- **[docs/agent/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/agent/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and design decisions
- **[docs/agent/README.md](docs/agent/README.md)** - Overview and development status

### Quick Start
1. Enable Agent Mode in plugin settings
2. Open Agent Mode panel via Tools ‚Üí OllamAssist ‚Üí Agent Mode
3. Use natural language to request development tasks
4. Review and approve each proposed action
5. Monitor results in unified interface

### Event System and Notifications

**IMPORTANT**: All notifications and events must use IntelliJ's MessageBus system:
- Use `project.getMessageBus().syncPublisher(TOPIC)` for synchronous notifications
- Define topics with `Topic.create("TopicName", Interface.class)`
- Follow IntelliJ's event-driven architecture patterns
- Examples: AgentStateNotifier, AgentTaskNotifier for agent mode notifications

### Agent Mode Architecture (LangChain4J Agentic)

**IMPORTANT**: The agent mode uses LangChain4J Agentic modules for AI agent functionality:

#### Core Architecture
- **Migration Strategy**: Progressive migration from custom TaskExecutors to LangChain4J Tools
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Hybrid approach with `@Tool` annotations
- **Future Phase**: Phase 2 - Full multi-agent LangChain4J agentic architecture

#### LangChain4J Agentic Integration
- **Dependencies**: `langchain4j-agentic` and `langchain4j-agentic-a2a` modules
- **Tools Declaration**: Use `@Tool` annotations for agent capabilities
- **Agent Communication**: AgenticScope for shared state between agents
- **Function Calling**: Native LLM tool calling instead of JSON parsing

#### Tools Implementation Pattern
```java
@Tool("Description of what this tool does")
public String toolMethod(
    @P("Parameter description") String param1,
    @P("Another parameter") String param2) {
    // Implementation using existing ExecutionEngine
    return result;
}
```

#### Agent Architecture Components
- **IntelliJDevelopmentAgent**: Main agent with development tools
- **FileOperationTools**: File creation, modification, deletion
- **CodeAnalysisTools**: Code inspection and analysis
- **GitOperationTools**: Version control operations
- **BuildTools**: Project compilation and testing

#### Integration Guidelines
- Preserve existing ExecutionEngine and TaskExecutor logic
- Wrap TaskExecutors as LangChain4J Tools using `@Tool` annotations
- Use AgenticScope for agent state management
- Maintain IntelliJ MessageBus integration for UI updates
- Follow ADR-002 migration strategy
